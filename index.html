    2:31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,
    whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form
    thereof was terrible.
    </p><p>
    2:32 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
    silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 2:33 His legs of iron, his
    feet part of iron and part of clay.
    </p><p>
    2:34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
    smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake
    them to pieces.
    </p><p>
    2:35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
    broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer
    threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was
    found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great
    mountain, and filled the whole earth.
    </p><p>
    2:36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
    before the king.
    </p><p>
    2:37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
    given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
    </p><p>
    2:38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
    field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and
    hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.
    </p><p>
    2:39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
    another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the
    earth.
    </p><p>
    2:40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
    breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh
    all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
    </p><p>
    2:41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay,
    and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in
    it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron
    mixed with miry clay.
    </p><p>
    2:42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,
    so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
    </p><p>
    2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
    mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one
    to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
    </p><p>
    2:44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
    kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
    left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all
    these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
    </p><p>
    2:45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
    mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the
    brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made
    known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is
    certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

    7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
    and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and
    told the sum of the matters.
    </p><p>
    7:2 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
    the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
    </p><p>
    7:3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
    another.
    </p><p>
    7:4 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till
    the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth,
    and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to
    it.
    </p><p>
    7:5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
    up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it
    between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour
    much flesh.
    </p><p>
    7:6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
    upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four
    heads; and dominion was given to it.
    </p><p>
    7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
    dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
    teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with
    the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
    before it; and it had ten horns.
    </p><p>
    7:8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
    another <span id="horn">little horn</span>, before whom there were three of the first horns
    plucked up by the roots: and, behold, <span id="horn">in this horn were eyes</span> like the
    eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
    </p><p>
    7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
    did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head
    like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his
    wheels as burning fire.
    </p><p>
    7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
    thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
    stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
    </p><p>
    7:11 I beheld then because of the voice of <span id="horn">the great words which the
    horn spake</span>: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body
    destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
    </p><p>
    7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
    taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
    </p><p>
    7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man
    came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and
    they brought him near before him.
    </p><p>
    7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that
    all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is
    an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
    that which shall not be destroyed.
    </p><p>
    7:15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
    the visions of my head troubled me.
    </p><p>
    7:16 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
    truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation

    7:17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall
    arise out of the earth.
    </p><p>
    7:18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
    possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
    </p><p>
    7:19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
    diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of
    iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and
    stamped the residue with his feet; 7:20 And of the ten horns that were
    in his head, and of <span id="horn">the other which came up</span>, and before whom three
    fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very
    great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.
    </p><p>
    7:21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
    prevailed against them; 7:22 Until the Ancient of days came, and
    judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came
    that the saints possessed the kingdom.
    </p><p>
    7:23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
    earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the
    whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
    </p><p>
    7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
    arise: and <span id="horn">another shall rise after them</span>; and he shall be diverse from
    the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
    </p><p>
    7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall
    wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and
    laws: and they shall be given into his hand until <span id="times">a time and times and
    the dividing of time.</span>
    </p><p>
    7:26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
    dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
    </p><p>
    7:27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
    under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of
    the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all
    dominions shall serve and obey him.
    </p><p>
    7:28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
    cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I
    kept the matter in my heart.

    8:1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
    appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto
    me at the first.
    </p><p>
    8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was
    at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw
    in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
    </p><p>
    8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
    before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were
    high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
    </p><p>
    8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
    that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that
    could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and
    became great.
    </p><p>
    8:5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on
    the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat
    had a notable horn between his eyes.
    </p><p>
    8:6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
    standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
    </p><p>
    8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
    choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and
    there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him
    down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that
    could deliver the ram out of his hand.
    </p><p>
    8:8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,
    the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward
    the four winds of heaven.
    </p><p>
    8:9 And out of one of them came forth <span id="horn">a little horn</span>, which waxed
    exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the
    pleasant land.
    </p><p>
    8:10 <span id="horn">And it waxed great</span>, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
    some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon
    them.
    </p><p>
    8:11 Yea, <span id="horn">he magnified himself</span> even to the prince of the host, and by
    him <span id="sacrifice">the daily sacrifice</span> was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary
    was cast down.
    </p><p>
    8:12 And <span id="horn">an host was given him</span> against <span id="sacrifice">the daily sacrifice</span> by reason
    of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
    practised, and prospered.
    </p><p>
    8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
    certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the
    daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
    sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?  8:14 And he said
    unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
    sanctuary be cleansed.
    </p><p>
    8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
    and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
    appearance of a man.
    </p><p>
    8:16 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which
    called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
    </p><p>
    8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
    and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man:
    for at the time of the end shall be the vision.
    </p><p>
    8:18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
    toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
    </p><p>
    8:19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the
    last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall
    be.
    </p><p>
    8:20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media
    and Persia.
    </p><p>
    8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that
    is between his eyes is the first king.
    </p><p>
    8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
    kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
    </p><p>
    8:23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
    are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding
    dark sentences, shall stand up.
    </p><p>
    8:24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he
    shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall
    destroy the mighty and the holy people.
    </p><p>
    8:25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
    his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace
    shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of
    princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
    </p><p>
    8:26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
    true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many
    days.
    </p><p>
    8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose
    up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision,
    but none understood it.

    the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the
    LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 9:21 Yea, whiles I was
    speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the
    vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about
    the time of the evening oblation.

    11:16 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
    seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, 11:17 Saying, We
    give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to
    come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast
    reigned.
    </p><p>
    11:18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
    of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give
    reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them
    that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which
    destroy the earth.

    11:19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
    in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and
    voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.

    12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with
    the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
    twelve stars: 12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in
    birth, and pained to be delivered.

    12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great
    red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon
    his heads.
    </p><p>
    12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
    cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which
    was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was
    born.
    </p><p>
    12:5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
    with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his
    throne.

    12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
    prepared of God, that they should feed her there <span id="times">a thousand two

    12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
    against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 12:8 And
    prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
    </p><p>
    12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
    Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out
    into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
    </p><p>
    12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
    salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of
    his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which
    accused them before our God day and night.

    12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word

    12:12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to
    the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down
    unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a
    short time.

    12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
    persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

    12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
    might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished
    for <span id="times">a time, and times, and half a time,</span> from the face of the serpent.

    12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
    woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

    12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
    and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

    12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
    with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
    have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

    13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out
    of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten
    crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
    </p><p>
    13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet
    were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and
    the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
    </p><p>
    13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
    deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

    13:4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast:
    and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who
    is able to make war with him?  13:5 And there was given unto him a
    mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto
    him to continue <span id="times">forty and two months.</span>

    13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
    his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
    </p><p>
    13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
    overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues,
    and nations.

    13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
    had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

    13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
    and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
    first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
    </p><p>
    13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
    from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 13:14 And deceiveth them
    that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had
    power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on
    the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the
    wound by a sword, and did live.
    </p><p>
    13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that
    the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as
    would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

    13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
    and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
    foreheads: 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had
    the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
    </p><p>
    13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
    of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
    hundred threescore and six.

    17:1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
    and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee
    the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: 17:2
    With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the
    inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
    fornication.

    17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
    saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
    blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
    </p><p>
    17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
    decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup
    in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
    17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
    GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
    </p><p>
    17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
    with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered
    with great admiration.

    17:7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
    tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth
    her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
    </p><p>
    17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
    of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on
    the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of
    life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that
    was, and is not, and yet is.

    17:10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the

    17:11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
    is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

    17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
    received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with
    the beast.
    </p><p>
    17:13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
    unto the beast.
    </p><p>
    17:14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome

    hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat
    her flesh, and burn her with fire.
    </p><p>
    17:17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
    agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God
    shall be fulfilled.

    17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
    reigneth over the kings of the earth.
